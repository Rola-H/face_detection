# Project description
Code Description: Face Detection using MTCNN.

This code demonstrates the implementation of face detection using the MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) algorithm, which is based on the work by Kaipeng Zhang et al. The MTCNN algorithm is known for its accuracy and efficiency in face detection.

The code starts by importing the necessary libraries, including the MTCNN module from the "mtcnn" package and the OpenCV library (cv2) for image processing, then the function is applied, finally, the modified image with bounding boxes drawn around the detected faces is returned.
